## Frontend

### Notes

- Setting Up Your React(Typescript) Frontend with Vite and Tailwind CSS.
- Create a New React Project with Vite : `pnpm create vite`
- You will be prompted to answer a few questions:
  - **Project name:** Enter a name, for example, `frontend`.
  - **Select a framework:** Use the arrow keys to choose `React`.
  - **Select a variant:** Choose `Typescript + SWC`.
- Install Project Dependencies:
  - cd frontend
  - pnpm install
  - pnpm approve-builds (to pick which dependencies should be allowed to run scripts - @swc/core, esbuild)
  - pnpm run dev ( opens our app in localhost:5173)
- Install and Configure [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) : `pnpm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer` & `pnpm install -D tailwind-merge class-variance-authority` (optional dependencies for better component management) & `pnpm install @tailwindcss/vite`

```txt
Manually create the `Tailwind config file`. In the root of your frontend folder, create a new file named tailwind.config.js and paste the following content into it. This is the crucial step that was missing.

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

- Add Icons and Application Code : `pnpm add lucide-react`

- Why Start with TypeScript? (react-ts)

  - Fewer Bugs: TypeScript's main feature is static typing. This means you define the "shape" of your data (like your Task objects). It will catch a huge number of common errors during development before you even run the code, such as typos in property names or passing the wrong type of data to a component.
  - Better Developer Experience: With VS Code, TypeScript provides incredible autocompletion, code navigation, and in-editor feedback. It makes your code more predictable and easier to work with, especially as the app grows.
  - Easier to Scale & Maintain: As you add a backend, user authentication, and more complex features, your data structures will become more involved. TypeScript makes managing this complexity much more straightforward. It acts as living documentation for your code.

- What is a Compiler in this Context?

  - When you write React code using TypeScript and JSX, a web browser can't understand it directly. A tool needs to "compile" or "transpile" your .tsx files into standard JavaScript that browsers can execute.
    - TypeScript (the standard option): This option uses a combination of tools. For speed during development, Vite uses a fast transpiler called esbuild. However, for checking your types, it still relies on the official TypeScript compiler (tsc).
    - TypeScript + SWC (the faster option): This option replaces esbuild with SWC (Speedy Web Compiler). SWC is a super-fast compiler written in Rust. It handles the job of converting your code even more quickly than esbuild.

- Recommendation : You get all the benefits of TypeScript (type safety, better code intelligence) combined with the best-in-class performance of the SWC compiler. This means your development server will start faster and your code will refresh more quickly when you make changes. There's really no downside for a new project.

- Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.It's fast, flexible, and reliable â€” with zero-runtime.
